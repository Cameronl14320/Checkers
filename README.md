# Checkers
 Personal Project - Checkers with Monte Carlo AI
 
 ![](https://github.com/Cameronl14320/Checkers/blob/master/checkers.gif)
 
# Implemented:
 
## GUI (100%)
 - Board display (*done*)
 - Game restart (*done*)
 - Main/Start Screen (*done*)
 - Undo button (*done*)
 - End jump early button (*done*)

## Game (100%)
 - Turn Based Gameplay (*done*)
 - Game finish (*done*)
 
 
## Pieces (100%)
 - King Promotion (*done*) - allows movement in all directions (up and down)
 - Forwards Movement (*done*) - if not promoted, only allowed to move towards other side
 - Basic Jump/Attack (*done*)
 - Multijump (*done*) - Can jump consecutively (optional)
  
## Monte Carlo (100%)
 - Get all valid moves (*done*)
 - Recursive Probability Decision Making (*done*)
 
## Side Notes
 - Decision Making takes too much time, needs to be far more efficient. 
 - Will need to rework on abstracting the Game from the GUI
